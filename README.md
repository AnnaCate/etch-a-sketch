## Etch-A-Sketch
An app that allows the user to draw a picture with their mouse. View live webpage [here](https://annacate.github.io/etch-a-sketch/).

## Motivation
This app was created as the second project in the "JavaScripts Basics" sub-section of the "Web Development 101" section of The Odin Project [curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses?ref=homenav).

## Technology used
HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript

## Instructions for use
Use your cursor to move over the white drawing area. Black squares will trail behind your cursor. Click the "Refresh" button to clear the grid. Click the "New Grid" button to change the number of squares in the grid: a prompt will ask you how many squares per side you would like your new grid to have. A higher number will equate to a smaller "brush" size (default number of squares is 16).
